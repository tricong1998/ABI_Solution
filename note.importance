1, With git:
- Don't push any references (libraries) which can be sync automatically by nuget.
- Don't push any changes with file .gitignore unless you was familiar on working with it.
- Don't push any file in .gitignore like *.log, Bin/Debug/, etc. (by default, these files will not be staged, unless you modified .gitignore file)

2, Some extension for Visual Studio (save my life):
  - color for output window: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MikeWard-AnnArbor.VSColorOutput
  - inheritance viewer: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=munyabe.TypeHierarchyViewer
  - template for new class (sth like @author, @date, etc.): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=StefanWenig.LicenseHeaderManager
  in order to install extension, there are 2 ways:
    + Tool -> Extensions & Updates -> Search what you want and follow the instruction
	+ search by Google or https://marketplace.visualstudio.com directly, download and simply click the file (*.vsix), follow the guide
